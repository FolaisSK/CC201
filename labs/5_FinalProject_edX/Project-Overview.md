<img src="/images/IDSN-logo.png" width="200" alt="cognitiveclass.ai logo"  />

##

## **Estimated time needed:** 10 mins

This final project will encourage you to use many of the tools and concepts that you have learned in this course. As you complete the project, you will need to take screenshots of your work to verify what you have done so that it can be graded. 

## Project Overview:Build and Deploy a Simple Health Application

The health application is a simple, multi-tier web application that you will build and deploy with Docker and Kubernetes. To start, you will deploy a simple health application that will have a text input where you can enter login details and submit it.To deploy our application you will create Kubernetes Deployments and Pods. Then you will apply Horizontal Pod Scaling to the health application, and finally, work on Rolling Updates and Rollbacks.

## Review Criteria

After completing the Hands-on Lab: Build and Deploy a Simple Health App, you will complete Peer-graded Assignment below.For each of the 10 tasks you will be required to upload a screenshot in JPEG (.jpg) format for your peers to review. This project is worth 20% of your total grade.
  
**Task 1:**  Complete the missing commands in the Dockerfile (**5 points**)

**Task 2:**  Confirm the Health image is correctly pushed to IBM Cloud Container Registry. (**1 point**)

**Task 4:**  Create a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. (**1 point**)

**Task 5:**  Correctly scale the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler replicas. (**2 points**)

**Task 6:**  Use the Docker build and push commands to update the Health App. (**2 points**)

**Task 7:**  Confirm you are using the proper deployment configuration for autoscaling. (**1 point**)

**Task 8:**  Access the updated Login page of the deployed Patient-UI – v2 application after the rollout of the deployment. (**2 points**)

**Task 9:**  Check the revision history for the deployment after rollout of the deployment. (**2 points**)

**Task 10:**  Review the updated deployment after rollback of the update. (**2 points**)
