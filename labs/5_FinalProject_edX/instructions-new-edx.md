::page{title="Final Project"}

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Build and deploy a simple health application
- Autoscale the Health application using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
- Perform Rolling Updates and Rollbacks

::page{title="Project Overview"}

Health application is a simple web application that we will build and deploy with Docker and Kubernetes. The application consists of a web front end which will have a text input where you can enter login details. We will create Kubernetes Pods and Deployments in order to deploy our application. Then we will apply Horizontal Pod Scaling to the health application and finally work on Rolling Updates and Rollbacks.

::page{title="Set-up : Cloning the git repository "}

1. If a terminal is not already open, open a terminal window by using the menu in the editor: `Terminal > New Terminal`.

> **Note:** Please wait for some time for the terminal prompt to appear.

2. Change to your project folder.

> **Note: If you are already on the `/home/project` folder, please skip this step.**

```
cd /home/project
```

3. Clone the git repository that contains the artifacts needed for this lab.

```
git clone https://github.com/ajp-io/patient-ui.git
```

<img src="images/clone.jpg"/> <br>

4. Change to the directory for this lab.

```
cd patient-ui
```

5. List the contents of this directory to see the artifacts for this lab.

```
ls
```

::page{title="Build the health app"}

Let's build and deploy the web front end for the health app.

Dockerfile incorporates a more advanced strategy called multi-stage builds, so feel free to read more about that [here](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/)
 
1. Open the Dockerfile from its last saved or downloaded location in File Explorer. The path to this file is `patient-ui/Dockerfile`.

2. Complete the Dockerfile with the necessary Docker commands to build and push your image. 

<details>
<summary>Tip!</summary>
The FROM instruction initializes a new build stage and specifies the base image that subsequent instructions will build upon.<br>
The COPY command enables us to copy files to our image. <br>
The COPY command enables us to copy files to our image. <br>
The RUN instruction executes commands.<br>
The CMD instruction provides a default for executing a container, or in other words, an executable that should run in your container.<br>
</details>

> Note: Copy the code of the completed dockerfile with you. You will be prompted to submit it in the text box in the Peer Assignment.

3. Export your namespace as an environment variable so that it can be used in subsequent commands.

Note: Identify your namespace by running **echo $MY_USERNAME** in the terminal window.

```
export MY_NAMESPACE=sn-labs-$USERNAME
```

<img src="images/export-sn.jpg"/> <br>

4. Build the health app using the Docker Build command.

<details>

<summary>Tip!</summary>

```
docker build . -t us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/patient-ui:v1
```

<br>
<img src="images/docker-build.jpg"/> <br>

</details>

5. Push the image to IBM Cloud Container Registry


<details>

<summary>Tip!</summary>

```
docker push us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/patient-ui:v1
```

<img src="images/docker-push.jpg"/> <br>

</details>

> **Note:** If you have tried this lab earlier,the previous session might still be persistent. In such a case, you will see a **'Layer already Exists'** message instead of the **'Pushed'** message  in the above output. If that happens,proceed with the next steps of the lab.

6.	Verify that the image was pushed successfully.

```
ibmcloud cr images
```

<img src="images/cr-image.jpg"/> <br>

> **Note:** If you see the status of the image as **'Scanning'**, please wait for 10 minutes & re-run the above command till the status gradually changes to **'No Issues'**. Even if status shows as **'1 issue'**, you can still proceed with lab.

>üì∑ Take a screenshot of the output of Step 5 and save it as a .jpg or .png with the filename `crimages.png`. You will be prompted to upload the screenshot in the Peer Assignment.

6. Create a new file with `deployment.yml` file in the `patient-ui` directory & paste the code for the deployment of the application:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: patient-ui
  labels:
    app: patient-ui
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: patient-ui
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25%
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: patient-ui
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: us.icr.io/<your sn labs namespace>/patient-ui:v1
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: patient-ui
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          name: http
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 50m
          requests:
            cpu: 20m  
  
```

> **Note:** Replace `<your sn labs namespace>` with your SN labs namespace. To check your SN labs namespace, please run the command `ibmcloud cr namespaces`

- It should look as below:

<img src="images/deployment.jpg"/> <br>

7. Apply the deployment using:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
```

8. Open a New Terminal and enter the below command to view your application:

```
kubectl port-forward deployment.apps/patient-ui 8080:8080
```

<img src="images/portforward.jpg"/> <br>

9. Launch your application on port 8080. Click on the Skills Network button on the right, it will open the **‚ÄúSkills Network Toolbox‚Äù**. Then click the **Other** then **Launch Application**. From there you should be able to enter the port and launch.

<img src="images/MicrosoftTeams-image__6_.png"/> <br>

10. Now you should be able to see your running application. Please copy the app URL which will be given as below:

<img src="images/v1output.jpg"/> <br>

>üì∑ Take a screenshot of your deployed application and save it as a .jpg or .png with the filename `app.png`. You will be prompted to upload the screenshot in the Peer Assignment.

11. Log into the health app using any credentials. Since the app is in demo mode right now, it will accept any credentials you enter.

::page{title="Autoscale the Health application using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler"}

1. Autoscale the health application deployment using `kubectl autoscale deployment`

<details>

<summary>Tip!</summary>

```
kubectl autoscale deployment patient-ui --cpu-percent=5 --min=1 --max=10
```

<img src="images/autoscaled.jpg"/> <br>

</details>

2. You can check the current status of the newly-made HorizontalPodAutoscaler, by running:

```
kubectl get hpa patient-ui
```

The current replicas is 0 as there is no load on the server.

>üì∑ Take a screenshot of your Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and save it as a .jpg or .png with the filename `hpa.png`. You will be prompted to upload the screenshot in the Peer Assignment.

3. Open another new terminal and enter the below command to generate load on the app to observe the autoscaling (Please ensure your port-forward command is running. In case you have stopped your application, please run the port-forward command to re-run the application at port 3000.)

```
kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --rm --image=busybox:1.35.0 --restart=Never -- /bin/sh -c "while sleep 0.01; do wget -q -O- <your app URL>; done"
```

- Please replace your app URL in the `<your app URL>` part of the above command.

> Note: Use the same copied URL which you obtained in step 11 of the previous task.

The command will be as below:

<img src="images/app-load-generation.jpg"/> <br>

> **Note:** In case you get a `Load generator already exists` error, please suffix a number after `load-generator` eg. `load-generator-1`, `load-generator-2`.

- You will keep getting an output similar as below which will indicate the increasing load on the app:

<img src="images/loadgenerator.jpg"/> <br>

> **Note:** Continue further commands in the 1st terminal

4. Run the below command to observe the replicas increase in accordance with the autoscaling:

```
kubectl get hpa patient-ui --watch
```

5. Run the above command again after 5-10 minutes and you will see an increase in the number of replicas which shows that your application has been autoscaled.

<img src="images/relicas.jpg"/> <br>

>üì∑ Take a screenshot of your Autoscaler details and save it as a .jpg or .png with the filename `hpa2.png`. You will be prompted to upload the screenshot in the Peer Assignment.

6. Run the below command to observe the details of the horizontal pod autoscaler:

```
kubectl get hpa patient-ui
```

<img src="images/relicascaled.jpg"/> <br>

- Please close the other terminals where load generator and port-forward commands are running.

::page{title="Perform Rolling Updates and Rollbacks on the Health application"}

> **Note:** Please run all the commands in the 1st terminal unless mentioned to use a new terminal.

1. Use the Explorer to edit login.html in the public directory. The path to this file is **patient-ui/public/login.html**.

2. Let‚Äôs edit the name beneath the logo to be more specific. On the line that says `<div class="Fictionalname">Example Health</div>`, change it to include your name. Something like `<div class="Fictionalname">Alex's Example Health</div>`. Make sure to save the file when you‚Äôre done.
